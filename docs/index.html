		This page contains documentation and examples of various parts of the
		Double Dot Labs CSS Framework - available through
		<a href="https://npmjs.com/package/@doubledotlabs/dot.css">NPM</a>,
		<a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/@doubledotlabs/dot.css/">UNPKG</a>,
		or in source form on
		<a href="https://github.com/doubledotlabs/dot-css">GitHub</a>.
		It is distributed as open source software under the
		<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/">Mozilla Public License</a>, version 2.0.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many of the components in this framework are based on Google's
		<a href="https://material.io/design/introduction">Material Design</a> system,
		which have been adapted for our own use. This documentation lacks a lot of the
		use cases & detailed examples present in Google's documentation, as it doesn't
		seem necessary to repeat them - instead, it focuses on functional code examples
		of each component.
